    Hi all,

    Here are the notes from today's 14 UTC meeting in irc.freenode.net #blendercoders.

    1) Release targets for Blender 2.76

        Planning
        According to schedule, we move to BCon3 today. That means that the release targets are defined, only what's agreed on and listed will go to git master.
        Target 'PTex' is going to be postponed again... we might need another developer to assist. Also to check on UDIM texture support.
        OpenSubdiv is in progress. Sergey suggests to make it a build option, because of OS X not supporting a mix of OpenGL 4 calls and older versions. Discussion on this is open...
        will be done here and/or in IRC.
        AMD news: OS X driver team managed to get the old Cycles ("Mega Kernel") compile and work, the next update of the beta "El Capitan" OS X should (might?) have this driver,
        we'll keep you posted. The OS X team is working with us on getting split kernel to work too.
        Interesting article, AMD writing about their Blender commitment.
        Antonis Ryakiotakis: speed optimizations for viewport are ready for master. Doc coming.

    2) Other projects

        Joshua Leung works on new Grease Pencil 'sculpt' feature for 2.77:

        Joerg Mueller: the new Audaspace library will go to the system libraries and not into external, so that we can check how building with that works out.
        Campbell worked on script setup to do more exact OpenGL performance benchmarking. (Volunteers needed to add content and create a great Blender bench for gfx cards).
        Gooseberry final dev report is still in progress...
